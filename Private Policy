I will be collects any data associated with this app but I won't be using it as I'm only a student and this is what was given to me by google in the firebase. 
The information that are stored are your email address, created date, signed in date, and user uid.
As for what you do in the app, I haven't program it to view what people put in their notes, only program it to hold everyone note to be put in their own secured folder. 
It is recommend to be careful with what you put in the app as I have no plan of updating this app in the future.
